    Mr Crocco Odile called the police at 3am this morning after hearing a sudden thud. "I was confused. This is usually a very quiet neighborhood, but this sound made my spine tingle. The police arrived too late: no criminals in sight, just the poor victim, no bruises, no blood, buried, no doubt. </p><p>
    What is more puzzling, however, is the increasing number of dead bodies in the city lately: not just in the Lagoon Swamp, not just in the Gator District, but everywhere. The authorities are calling for caution: don't go out alone at night, try to avoid crowds, report any suspicious activity. </p><p>
    We are looking for help to reduce violence in the city. The situation is dramatic. The government is ready to involve anyone who can help.</p>

                    <p>BERLIN — Searching the cab
                        of the tractor-trailer that plowed
                        through a Christmas market in
                        Berlin, the authorities made two
                        startling discoveries: a badly
                        bruised body with stab and gunshot
                        wounds, and the wallet of a
                        Tunisian labeled a security threat
                        who was supposed to have been
                        deported months ago.</p>
                    <p>The identity of the Tunisian,
                        Anis Amri, immediately alarmed
                        intelligence officials from Europe
                        to Washington. German officials
                        acknowledged that Mr. Amri was
                        known to have links to a radical
                        Salafist preacher and had been in
                        their custody pending deportation
                        proceedings after being caught
                        with fake papers. He was freed,
                        even though he
                        was considered
                        potentially dangerous
                        by the
                        authorities</p>

<p>
  "I feel that the world is becoming more and more violent...", thought Crocolock when reading its daily morning journal before heading to the police headquarters.
  And he knew he was not the only one filling this way. At work, they had recently discussed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-06/Ipsos-Global-Advisor-Crime-Law-Enforcement-Full-Report.pdf">study</a> on reported crime and the perception of violence around the word. <br/>
  After acknowledging these news, Crocolock couldn't sit still. As one of the best detectives of the Alligators's city, he wanted to understand more about what could increase criminality.<br/>
  Confused, he decided to call his acolyte : Gatson, a very smart cinema critic. He had seen all movies released since the 1901 (nearly), and was so passionate about movies that he was sometimes disconnected from the real world.  <br/>
  "Hi, Gatson. Yes, it's Crocolock. Have you seen the news? Isn't it frightening, all this violence?" <br/>
</p>

<img style="float: right;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Gatson.png" alt="one other crocodile"/>
<p>"Uhm, no, I haven't Crocolock. But I read an <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262287/#:~:text=The%20results%20demonstrate%20that%20the,reduces%20behavioral%20inhibition%20in%20adolescents.
  ">interesting paper</a> recently, stating that the more time adolescents spend watching violent movies, the more they are prone to making wrong decisions, such as drug abuse or illegal driving. Everyone doesn't agree on the impact of 
  movies, of course, but that was still interesting."</p>
  
<p>
  An idea struck Crocolock's mind: could violence in real life and movie violence be correlated? <br/>
  That's how the investigation started! He ran to the headquarters as fast as he could and entered like a hurricane in Professor Ada Reptking's office to explain his theory.</p>

<img style="float: left;padding-right: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Professore_Ada_Reptking.png" alt="again a crocodile"/>
  <p>
    CALM DOWN Croco, you are too hot-blooded ! You can't just claim a correlation because your gut tells you to do so ! <br/>
    Enough crocodile tears ! Let's be pragmatic : you have to perform data analysis, and I will help you, if you bring me some datasets and a coffee.
  </p> 
  <p>
    First, we have to state clearly what your topic is and define a set of research questions.</p> <br/>
  
    <div class="postIT">
      <p class="textdo">Hover !</p>
      <h2 class="titlefunfact">FunFact : Crocodile tears</h2>
      <img class="imgPostIt" src="assets/img/SadCroco.webp" alt="Workflow">
      <p class="textfunfact">"Crocodile tears" is a expression standing for a insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. 
        The phrase derives from an ancient belief that crocodiles shed tears while consuming their prey. <br/>
        Actually, crocodile produce tears to hydrate there eyes, this is not linked to emotion and can be triggered by feeding !
        </p>
    </div> <br/>
    
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">How do real word violence and movies violence influence each other ? </h1> 
<p>
  Can we identify periods of unusually violent releases? Can we identify genres that are particularly violent?
  Is there a significant (positive or negative) correlation between the prevalence of violent movies and reported violent crimes in the US ? 
  In other words, can we say that violent movies increase real-world violence, or that they serve as a release that reduces it?
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, let's define the context.<br/> 
  Violence, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/so0006#:~:text=Violence%20refers%20to%20the%20intentional,a%20community%2C%20or%20a%20government.">UUDR</a>, 
  refers to the intentional or unintentional use of force, whether physical or psychological, threatened or actual, against an individual, oneself, or against a group of people, a community, or a government. <br/>
  We will focus on the United States of America, relating violent events within each State to the release of violent movies in the country. 
  </p>

<br/>
<h1 style="text-align: center">The data investigation</h1>
<img style="float: left;padding-right: 20px" class="gators" src="assets/img/DeepDive.png" alt="again a crocodile"/>
<p>
As Crocolock would say, let's focus on the journey ! 
But Professor Reptking first suggests you to deep dive into the chosen datasets choose, the cleaning procedure and the models and methods used along the way! (Just hover over the red text, click, and dive with us). <br/>

<p>
To be able to correlate real life violence and movies violences, we first have to quantify violence on both sides. <br/>
Our data journey will begin with the study of violence in movies starting from the CMU movie dataset. <br/>
Secondly, we will analyse the national incident-based reporting system of the FBI to construct a violence score for each State of America.<br/>
Finally, we will asses the correlation between the two metrics using an auto-regressive distributed lag model.<br/>
Here's the path we followed. 
</p>

<img style="margin: auto;"src="assets/diagram/workflow.png" alt="Workflow">


<h2>Movie violence classification</h2>
<p>
Fortunately, said Ada, We have the CMU movie Dataset. Since time will play a crucial role in our study and precise release dates are often unavailable, missing dates were filled using another Movies Dataset from Kaggle.
If you are interested, you can find more about these datasets in the  <div class="hover-container"> dataset pages

    </a>
  </div> .
</p>

<h4>Violence subjectivity</h4>
<p>
  We have to construct a metric for violent movies. 
  To do so, we have to classify American movies into different level of violence, using only the plots we have. 
  But what about subjectivity ? <br/>
  "We can conduct a pilot survey to manually classify a subset of movies !" proposes Gatson.
</p>
<p>
  We asked people (shut-out to all our friends!) to classify in 3 categories :
  <ul>
    <li>Violent</li>
    <li>Mild</li>
    <li>Peaceful</li>
  </ul>
 Each movie has been classified multiple times to compare the results from different individuals. We relabelled all data with ambiguous results to create a validation set for the following classification model (see below).
</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20744430"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20744430/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
150 movies have been labelled. Across the 80 that have at least been labelled two times, <b>30%</b> have been labelled differently. 
Especially, 3 movies have been assigned to opposite labels! (Of which two had the 3 labels and one had the opposite). <br/>
"The notion of violence is complex and a clear definition of each level of violence will be crucial to create a good classification model" concludes Ada.

<h4>Movie violence classification</h4>
<p>
  "We Could try sentiment analysis to classify the data." propose naively Gatson. 
  Ada take her computer and make a try, but the accuracy in the validation set don't exceed <b>30%</b> 
  "The concept of violence is too complex to be apprehended by a model with 6 sentiment, we will find another way to classify, but we will take a look at sentiment later" declare Ada.
  <div class="hover-container">
    Here for a deeper look into the sentiment analysis and the later assesment of the model.

            </div> 
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
</p><p>
To classify the data, we will use the large language model <a target="_blank" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini">Chat-GPT-4o mini</a> from OpenIA. 
Following the past finding, Ada engineered a prompt with a clear set of instruction (classification and return type). A scale of violence with a clear definition of each levels, and a set of examples.
<div class="hover-container">
  Here for a deeper look into the LLM model.
    <a href="3Methods/#LLM" class="card">
         <h3 class="card__title">LLM model</h3>
         <div class="bloodCard">

            <div class="drop3"></div>
          </div> 
      </div>
    </a>
  </div> <br/>
We first classified the data between the 3 levels given to the crocodiles before, and secondly between 2 levels : violent and non-violent. 
<p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20746442"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20746442/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
The last model end up with <b>66.38% accuracy</b> on the validation set. <br/>
At both extremes, the model successes to label the data most of the time, with some mislabelling to "Mild". Out of 116 movies, only 2 have a opposite labelling (violent to peaceful). 
Interestingly, the model tends to be more extreme than humans, labelling half of the mild category as peaceful or violent. For the purposes of the following analysis, we will remove the mild category.
<br/><br/>
"The model performs relatively well. However, we saw that this labelling is subjective. To assess the correctness of our classification, we will analyse the results using the Empath model from the Empath package in Python.", suggests Ada. <br/>
"What is the Empath package? What does it do?", asks Crocolock. <br/>
"The Empath package is a tool that utilizes a pre-trained model, built using techniques like word embeddings, to group words into meaningful categories based on their context. We will use it to scan through movie summaries and verify that movies labelled as violent by the LLM are indeed dominated by violent categories (I expect to see crime, anger, kill, etc.). It’s a quick a way to figure out how much violent language pops up in a text without doing all the heavy lifting yourself. We avoid having to craft lists of violent words ourselves, introducing biases and incoherences (as I did once in the past...).

<h4>Categorisation of the classification: are movies correctly grouped?</h4>

<p>
Ada returns back to her desk and decides to perform some preliminary analysis. First, she looks at the first two components of a 10-dimensional PCA regression run on the entire datasets. Each colour represents the main category brought up by the movie, amongst the 10 categories appearing most across the entire dataset. <br/>
"Can we see clusters?", she mumbles to herself. <br/>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20754617"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20754617/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>

</p><p>
We clearly can! In fact, films dominated by emotions such that: kill, negative_emotion, death and crime are most correlated on the upper part of the plot. The lower part, on the other hand, is dominated by films of categories such that: children, party, home, wedding, family. <br/>
Clearly, the two types of films seem to be quite distinct: on the one hand, films that we can classify as violent and, on the other hand, peaceful films.<br/>
</p><p>
Armed with this information, we move on to the analysis of the films as classified by Chat-GPT-4o mini, hoping to validate their grouping into the two classes: violent and non-violent. <br/>
For this, we extract the ten most represented categories in both groups. Violent movies are dominated by: crime, kill, family, death, negative_emotion, fight, war, children, weapon and traveling. Apart from the last emotion, which is questionably related to the sphere of violence, all others are clearly closely attached to gruesome contexts. <br/>
Non-violent movies bring up: family, children, party, home, wedding, speaking, traveling, communication, celebration, friends. Clearly, much more positively inclined categories. We also notice that traveling is present once again. Hence, we conclude it just be a recurrent theme across all types of movies. <br/>
"True, who doesn't dream of visiting the world?", wonders Ada. <br/>
As last consideration, we look at 10 randomly sampled movies from both groups. When we look at the violent movies, we immediately see that the violent categories cited above describe as much as 35% of the content. Considering that the empath package has 200 categories, we are satisfied with this finding. We also look at the top 10 non-violent categories' representation in the same 10 movies. We see that they reach at most 25%. Hence, non-violent categories are indeed overall less represented in violent movies than the violent ones! <br/>

Ada continued for several hours to look at individual movies in the same was as described above. She is confident: movies from either group are coherent with the categories they depict. She points at some specific cases, such as Muder-Set-Pieces (violent group) which has no peaceful category at all (from the 10 most represented), but nearly totally 35% from the violent ones. "This movie is surely correctly classified! Look here Crocolock.". <br/>
For completeness, we also perform the same analysis for movies grouped as non-violent. We reach the same conclusion: non-violent categories are more present in these movies than the violent categories. We are satisfied (and Ada too), so let's move on!
</p>


<h4>A look into violent movies</h4>
Nice ! Now that we have violent movies, we can perform some analysis on them. <br/>
What are the main genres of violent and non violent movies ? 

<div class="GraphContainer">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Main genre for violent movies are thriller, drama, horror, action/adventure, action and crime fiction. We can also see multiple other genre known to be tense. Interestingly, comedy, romance films and romantic drama also appear. <br/>
The main genre for non-violent movies are comedy, drama, romance film, family film and romantic comedy. A lot of children friendly genres are also present. <br/>
</p>
<p>
However, some genres are present in the two lists. This is expected, because some genres are obviously more common, such as comedy and drama. To account for that, we also plotted more present genres weigthed by the genre prevalence in general.
</p>

      </div>
  </div>
</div>

This analysis is limited. A lot of genre here are really "niche" but we can still see a clear tendency. For violent movies, we have genres such as psychological horror, wars or hardcore pornography. For non-violent movies we have travel, children's, education, fitness or journalism...

<h4>Bag of Words ?</h4>

<p>
Seeing all these analysis, Crocolock had an idea: "Can we have a look at the words themselves? Just as a side quest, I would like to see if the words used to describe violence are the same as those we use on an everyday basis.".<br/>
This question granted him a side-eye glance from Ada. But there she goes.<br/>
We can see her results below. There are indeed some differences, we notice the words: kill, murder, follow, etc. in violent movies and love, home, etc. for peaceful movies. <br/>
"Can we move on?", asks Ada. <br/>
"Yes, please?", returns Crocolock with a big smile.

<h4>What does time say ?</h4>

It is time to try to answers to our first question : are violence movies more present today ?

Let's take a look at the distribution of violent movies in time.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20790058"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20790058/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
If we look only the number of violent movies, we can easily say: yes, the it increases! However, there is a trick there. Look now at the total number of movie release per year: the number of violent movies and the total number of movies increases following the same pattern. 
</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20853357"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20853357/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
<p>
Look at the ratio of violent movies over all movies. Surprise, the ratio does increase, but really slowly. We can say that there are in general more violent movies per year between 1970 and 2013 than between 1913 and 1940. There is a sudden increase in the 70', with no return to the precedent ratio afterwards.
We also observe an oscillation between periods with relatively high or low number of violent movies. <br/>
For example, the ratio drops around 1917, 1921, 1929, 1937. More recently, there is a drop in 1979 and a spike in 1981. Outliers at the border are due to the low number of movie data.
</p>

<p> This was for the yearly trend, but within a year, is there a pattern ? </p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20791318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20791318/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
  The plot above shows weekly trends in movies release by combining the data from all years. The trend of violent movies release follows the trend of total movies released. In general, more movies are released at the beginning of September (the beginning of the academic year!) and at the end and beginning of the year (for Christmas and to start the New Year!).
  Less movies are released during the summer. Do people watch movies during hot holidays?
  Additionally, the ratio of violent movies is constant across the weeks.
</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20790742"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20790742/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
<p>
  To achieve a more granular vision, we plot the weekly releases by year from 1893 to 2018. No particular trend is to be seen. We only observe, once again, that movies are produced in bigger quantity nowadays.  
</p>

<h4>Define a metric : Box office revenue </h4>
<p>
  "In order to run a meaningful correlation analysis of violence in films on real-world violence, you need to think of your independent variable as a <i>treatment</i>", said Ada.
  For this, our classification of films in violent and peaceful comes in handy! However, this was only the first step. We need more information about the movies that we classified as violent! 
  So how can we follow Ada's advice? 
</p>
<p>
  Let's break it down this way: Simply counting the number of violent movies released in a specific timespan does not seem to fully grasp the complexity of our question of interest. 
  A good intention for this statement is the following: If there are a lot of violent movies released, but nobody watches them, we do not assume those movies to have a large influence on the society. 
  On the other hand, if there is only one violent movie released, but nearly everybody watches it, it could have a significant influence on society! Having this in mind, we search for a variable that could capture the popularity of the violent movies released.
</p>
<p>
  For this, one information seems quite suitable: the box office revenue! The box office revenue is highly correlated with the popularity of a movie, i.e. it is high when a lot of people watched the movie (popular movie) and low when only a few people watched it (unpopular movie). 
  Using the box office revenue of the films we classified as violent, we can thus approximate the prevalence of violent movies during a specific time period.
  Therefore, we choose the box office revenue as the <i>treatment</i>, i.e. our main independent variable, for the correlation analysis!
</p>
<p>
  Delighted about our findings, we go back to Professor Ada. "You have done a very good job so far, the box office revenue seems to be a good proxy for the prevalence of violent movies." answered Ada with a satisfied smile on his face. 
  "To go further and not loose any time, I forward you directly to my colleague from the finance department, Prof. Dexter CrossProfit. He has all the financial data you need."
</p>

<img style="float: left;padding-right: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Dexter.png" alt="again a crocodile"/>
<p>
  "Of course I can provide you the box office revenues of all your films in the dataset! Let me just crunch some data.", said Dexter, whilst turning on some heavy-metal music and disappeared behind his computer. 
  After 5 minutes, he claps his hands and says "All done, folks! It's all in the CMU dataset." <br/>
</p>

<p>
  "Look at these plots", says Dexter, pointing at his screen. <br/>
  Firstly, in the first plot you can see the box office of all movies released in a year: violent and total. We notice immediately that the medians are extremely close between these two groups, for all years, and that the confidence intervals overlap.
  We are reassured, people don't watch violent movies more than peaceful movies. <br/> 
  Similarly as before, we want to see granuarly how the box office evolves per week, for every year. However, we just use data from 1992 to 2012 (due to floods in Dexter's office, or to CMU datasets limitations). <br/>
  One interesting fact is that movies released between week 25 and 27 tend to reach higher box offices on average. Note that we saw before that less movies are released in this period. Therefore, we conclude that the box office is a better proxi for movie popularity compared to the simple count of movies released.

<p>
  Full of motivation, we continue our analysis: We filter the CMU dataset to only include the movies we classified as violent and use the release date to extract the week and the year in which the film was released. <br/>
  For the explanation about the weekly time window, please see in the <div class="hover-container">
    Models & Methods.
      <a href="3Methods" class="card">
           <h3 class="card__title">Models & methods</h3>

            </div> 
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
    Now that we are sure about all of this, we can create the final dataframe for our analysis model. We count the number of violent movie releases and we sum up the box office revenues of all violent movies per week. This gives us the final dataframe for the violent movies. 
    We now have the values for every week in the time span 1901 - 2018 (see the plot below).

<h2>Real life violence</h2>

<img style="float: right;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Yodada.png" alt="a frog"/>

<p>"We investigated movie violence, but what about real life violence ?" Gator asked. 
  Without answering, Crocolock entered the stairwell and began to descend. Five minutes later, 
  they arrived in the basement, right in Yodada's office, the archivist of the FBI headquarters.
<br/>
"Sure, help you I can, but data we need". He handed Crocolock a list of names, asking him to find all the data in the archive, 
  and began tapping nervously on his computer.</p>

<h4>Exploring the NIBS dataset</h4>

<p>"What’s NIBRS?"" Gator asked, flipping through a dusty file labeled "CDE."<br/>

Crocolock didn't look up from the map on which he was tracing the path. "National Incident-Based Reporting System. Crime data, straight from the FBI’s vault."<br/>

Gator’s eyebrows rose. "And the Crime Data Explorer?"<br/>

"FBI’s playground," Crocolock said, finally looking up. "Over 18,000 agencies feeding reports into the system. Voluntary for non-federal agencies, of course, but it’s as close to the truth as it gets. 

  Problem is, what’s reported isn’t always everything that happens..."<br/>

Yodada said: "Population size, economy, laws. They all change the story of the numbers." 

  "Still, this data reveals a lot. Dates. Victims. Locations. Even the types of injuries. You want insight? You’ve got it. 

  But be warned: there’s more to crime than the FBI’s definitions."<br/>

"Violent crime," Gator said. "Homicide. Rape. Robbery. Aggravated assault..."<br/>

"Force or threats," Yodada finished, a hint of impatience in his tone. "But what about Animal Cruelty? Unclassified? Clearly violent."<br/>

Crocolock smirked. "We adjust the categories. The data’s ours to shape! Look at these plots"</p>

<p>When looking at the count of offenses, some states might appear to be more violent simply due to their larger populations such as Michigan or Ohio. 

  However, normalization reassures us that this is not necessarily the case. 

  By adjusting for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.factmonster.com/us/fifty-states/state-population-rank-2012">population size</a>, we see that states with high offense counts may not always have 

  the highest offense rates per capita. It provides us a clearer and fairer comparison of crime levels between states.<br/>

Then, Yodada studied the yearly reports and muttered, "Let’s dive deeper into the trends of violence... 2012 will be our year of choice!" he said.<br/>

"And why 2012?" Gator asked.<br/>

"That’s when most states spoke," Yodada replied. </p>

<p> Crocolock fingers danced across the keyboard. "Let’s see what their voices reveal..."</p>

<iframe style="margin-left: -20px;" src="{{ '/assets/plotly/Z_score_2012.html' | relative_url }}" 

width="100%"

height="800px" 

frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>"What do the trends tell us?" Gator asked, staring at the screen displaying the plots.<br/>

Yodada adjusted his glasses, leaning closer to the data points. 

  "The z-score plot," he began, "reveals how violent offenses deviate from the norm for each state. 

  Weekly spikes and dips tell their own story—localized events, external influences or maybe patterns hidden in the chaos..."<br/>

Gator looked at the chart. "So, those peaks... are they meaningful?"<br/>

"Indeed," Yodada replied. "Notice how certain weeks align with events like public holidays or major announcements. 

  Take Week 18, for example: Obama's statement on same-sex marriage. A reaction, perhaps? 

  And Week 44, Halloween—spikes across the board could be likely tied to festivities."<br/>

Crocolock, now hunched over his keyboard. "And that's just the z-scores. 

  The normalized data per capita tells a different tale." He pulled up another plot. 

</p>

<iframe style="margin-left: -20px;" src="{{ '/assets/plotly/normalized_score_2012.html' | relative_url }}" 

width="100%"

height="800px" 

frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>

  "Here, states like Delaware and Tennessee stand out. Not because of sheer numbers, but because their rates are disproportionately high."<br/>

"Small states look bigger," Gator noted.<br/>

"Precisely," Yodada confirmed. "It's the power of normalization! It makes comparisons between states more fair. But it also has its blind spots 

  like making smaller populations appear more significant than they might be."<br/>

Yodada leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. "Between the two plots, the story becomes clearer. 

  Z-scores show us the noise, the anomalies. And normalization reveals the scale. Together, they paint a fuller picture of violence across the states in 2012."
</p> 

<h4>How to quantify violence ?</h4>

<p>
  To go with our analysis, let’s restrict ourselves to only 6 offense categories based on the ones <a target="_blank" href="https://www.factmonster.com/us/fifty-states/state-population-rank-2012">described as the most violent by croco FBI.</a> 
  Note that there is a limitation of our analysis and mutliple tests should be performed to further fine-tune this choice. This choice is also due 
  to the will of choosing categories that are present among all states considered in our analysis!<br/>
So what after? We have decided to limit our analysis to 6 offense categories, but how do they look like ? Do we see anything special ?
<br/>
  "Plot, you should, acquire knowledge, you will." tells Yodada.<br/>
 Let's listen to this wise advice. Since it consists only in a  preliminary analysis, let's restrict ourself to only one year and 
  observe the different patterns accross the weeks.
</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-heatmap" data-src="visualisation/20876482"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20876482/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="heatmap visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>"Clearer now disparities are !" points out Yodada. Larceny/Theft Offenses shadow all other offenses, at least for the year 2012. But what happens accross the years ? For that, we need to know more about the years our data span.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-heatmap" data-src="visualisation/20885727"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20885727/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="heatmap visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>"Phew, we narrowly avoided a disaster! There seems to be an issue with your boss' data collection...", says Gator.<br/>
  "No ones perfect are !" replies an offuscated Yodada. <br/>"For sure, let's move on, shall we" says our very pragmatic Crocolock.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20886100"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20886100/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
  Interesting! The trend seems to remain, all available years combined: we still have <i>Assault Offenses</i> and <i>Larceny/Theft Offenses</i> But, maybe it is a localised phenomenon, what about the other states ?   
  <br/>
"Remember the earlier analysis, you should", says Yodada. <br/>
Indeed, with the previous circles plot, we can observe that indeed Larceny was majorly present across all states and thus in our choice still remain an outlier. 
  Let’s keep this in mind but not remove it. We will deal with it via z-score standardization.
  <br/>
  We now need to create a metric for the violent score. Counts, ratio, z-scores normalisation, min-max normalisation,... The list could go on!
  But since we are interested in the time effect, we have to be careful not to include information from the future. 
  Indeed, z-score taking into account all the available data as we did before is great to analyse the trends but, as soon 
  as we move in time domain analysis, it results in errors. 
  <br/>"Indeed, it would be like doing time-travels, but we are not Marty and Dr. Emmet", points out Yodada, referencing Back to the future.</p>

  <p> 
  "Let’s do a first approximate by summing all counts per week, no matter the category. I will dwelve in the subtle details of time-related data later."
  <br/>

  This approach allows a general picture but have the huge drawback to consider all offenses category equally violent and do not take care of any imbalanced. <br/>

  "Let's take an example. Let imagine in week X 36 assaults have been commited but no homicide. Then week X+1, 1 assault and 35 murders has been commited. Those two weeks would appear equally violent, when their pattern isn't at all the same! How to correct this ? Z-score normalisation per category !" <br/>
 
   "But you mentionned that we couldn't look into the future to process our data...", said Gator.<br/>
   "Well done! You're a quick learner. Indeed we can't simply take the mean and stantard deviation of the whole period consider. But this can be solved with the concept of past causal window. 
   This means that for a given position <i>t</i> in the time, the rolling window includes only the current value and the values prior to it. 
   It therefore preserves the natural timescale of the events while scaling them so that they are comparable."</p>

<p>We again observe again patterns corresponding to weeks where a particular event arise. This confirms that we haven’t distorted 
  our real-life violence data! Note that, to enable their use in our model, we will aggregate them into a single value per week for each year consider. 

  <br/>"Taking care of chosing only states and consecutive years where we have data right ?", hazards Crocolock.<br/>
  "Indeed ! Our previous analysis still remains useful ! See the power of data analysis !", triumphs Ada while entering the room.</p>

"See, this is how it works. So, let's start with the formula...", Ada is eager to continue her exploration but is interrupted by an annoyed Crocolock: <br/>
"Ehm, can't we just jump directly to the conclusions of all this?".</p>

<h1 >Conclusion</h1>

<p>
Here we are, this is the end of the journey, and what a journey !
We found violent movies and anayzed trends in both violent and peaceful scenario. We extracted a metric for movie popularity using the box office. 
Then, we worked with real word data to analyse the level of violence in the U.S., and extracted a metric of violence. 
Finally, we regressed this two findings upon one another to evaluate the correlation between real life violence and movie violence.
What did Crocolock, Gator, Ada and Yodada conclude? That there is no immediate correlation between real world violence and movie violence. <br/>
Of course, their conclusion depends on the means they had: limited data available, potential confounding factors 
they could not control. However, they reassuringly know now that cinematographic violence is not a clear 
responsible for real world violence, which is already a happy ending!

<p>
  It is the end of the adventure for Crocolock, but he knows he still has new mysteries to solve. The sunlight
  is slowly dissapearing, transforming the water in a red and orange painting. Peacefully, he returns to where it belongs.
