    Mr Crocco Odile called the police at 3am this morning after hearing a sudden thud. "I was confused. This is usually a very quiet neighbourhood, but this sound made my spine tingle. The police arrived too late: no criminals in sight, just the poor victim, no bruises, no blood, buried, no doubt. </p><p>
    What is more puzzling, however, is the increasing number of dead bodies in the city lately: not just in the Lagoon Swamp, not just in the Gator District, but everywhere. The authorities are calling for caution: don't go out alone at night, try to avoid crowds, report any suspicious activity. </p><p>
    We are looking for help to reduce violence in the city. The situation is dramatic. The government is ready to involve anyone who can help.</p>

                    <p>BERLIN — Searching the cab
                        of the tractor-trailer that plowed
                        through a Christmas market in
                        Berlin, the authorities made two
                        startling discoveries: a badly
                        bruised body with stab and gunshot
                        wounds, and the wallet of a
                        Tunisian labeled a security threat
                        who was supposed to have been
                        deported months ago.</p>
                    <p>The identity of the Tunisian,
                        Anis Amri, immediately alarmed
                        intelligence officials from Europe
                        to Washington. German officials
                        acknowledged that Mr. Amri was
                        known to have links to a radical
                        Salafist preacher and had been in
                        their custody pending deportation
                        proceedings after being caught
                        with fake papers. He was freed,
                        even though he
                        was considered
                        potentially dangerous
                        by the
                        authorities</p>

<p>
  "I feel that the world is becoming more and more violent...", thought Crocolock when reading its daily morning journal before heading to the police headquarters.
  And he knew he was not the only one filling this way : At work, they recently discussed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-06/Ipsos-Global-Advisor-Crime-Law-Enforcement-Full-Report.pdf">study</a> on reported crime and the perception of violence around the word. <br/>
  After acknowledging these news, Crocolock couldn't sit still. As one of the best detective of the Alligators's city, he wanted to understand more what could increase criminality.<br/>
  Confused, he decided to call his acolyte : Gatson, a very smart cinema critic. He had seen all movies released since the 1901 (nearly), and was so passionate about movies that he was sometimes disconnected from the real world.  <br/>
  "Hi, Gatson. Yes, it's Crocolock. Have you seen the news? Isn't it frightening, all this violence?" <br/>
</p>

<img style="float: right;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Gatson.png" alt="one other crocodile"/>
<p>"Uhm, no, I haven't Crocolock. But I read a <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262287/#:~:text=The%20results%20demonstrate%20that%20the,reduces%20behavioral%20inhibition%20in%20adolescents.
  ">interesting paper</a> recently, stating that the more time adolescents spend watching violent movies, the more they are prone to making wrong decisions, such as drug abuse or illegal driving. Everyone doesn't agree on the impact of 
  movies, of course, but that was still interesting."</p>
  
<p>
  An idea struck Crocolock's mind: could violence in real life and movie violence be correlated? <br/>
  That's how the investigation started! I ran to the headquarters as fast as he could and enter like a hurricane in Professor Ada ReptKing office to propose his thesis.</p>

<img style="float: left;padding-right: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Professore_Ada_Reptking.png" alt="again a crocodile"/>
  <p>
    CALM DONE Croco, you almost look like a hot-blooded ! You can't just claim a correlation because your gut tell you so ! <br/>
    Enough crocodile tears ! let's be Pragmatic : you have to perform data analysis, and I will help you, if you brings me some datasets and a coffee.
  </p> 
  <p>
    First, we have to state a clear problematic and a set of research Questions.</p> <br/>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How do real word violence and movies violence influence each other ? </h1> 
<p>
  Can we identify periods of abnormally many releases of violent movies? Can we identify genres that are particularly violent?
  Is there a significant (positive or negative) correlation between the prevalence of violent movies and reported violent crimes in the US ? 
  In another word, can we say that violent movies increase real-world violence, or that they serve as a release that reduces it?
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, let's define the context.<br/> 
  Violence, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/so0006#:~:text=Violence%20refers%20to%20the%20intentional,a%20community%2C%20or%20a%20government.">UUDR</a>, 
  refers to the intentional or unintentional use of force whether physical or psychological, threatened or actual, against an individual, oneself, or against a group of people, a community, or a government. <br/>
  We will focus on the United state of America, relating violent events within each states to the release of violent movies in the area.

    <h2 class="titlefunfact">FunFact : Crocodile tears</h2>
    <img class="imgPostIt" src="assets/img/SadCroco.webp" alt="Workflow">
    <p class="textfunfact">"Crocodile tears" is a expression standing for a insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. 
      The phrase derives from an ancient belief that crocodiles shed tears while consuming their prey. <br/>
      Actually, crocodile produce tears to hydrate there eyes, this is not linked to emotion and can be triggered by feeding !

<p>
To be able to correlate real life violence and movies violences, we first have to quantify violence on both side. <br/>
Our data journey will begin with the study of violence in movies starting from the CMU movie dataset. <br/>
Secondly, we will analysis the national incident-based reporting system of the FBI to construct a violence score for each states of america.<br/>
Finally, we will asses the correlation between the two metrics using an auto-regressive distributed lack model.
</p>

<img style="margin: auto;"src="assets/diagram/workflow.png" alt="Workflow">


<h2>Movie violence classification</h2>
<p>
Fortunately, said Ada, We have the CMU movie Dataset. Since time will play a crucial role in our study and precise release dates are often unavailable, missing dates were filled using another Movies Dataset from Kaggle.
If you are interested, you can find more about these datasets in the  <div class="hover-container"> dataset pages

    </a>
  </div> .
</p>

<h4>Violence subjectivity</h4>
<p>
  We have to construct a metric for violent movies. 
  To do so, we have to classify american movies in different level of violence, using only the plots we have. 
  But what about subjectivity ? <br/>
  "We can conduct a pilot survey to manually classify a subset of movies !" propose Gatson.
</p>
<p>
  We asked people to classify in 3 categories :
  <ul>
    <li>Violent</li>
    <li>Mild</li>
    <li>Peaceful</li>
  </ul>
 Each movies have been classified multiple times to compare the result between different individuals. We relabelled all data with ambiguous result to create a validation set for the following classification model.
</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20744430"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20744430/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
150 movies have been labelled. Across the 80 that have at least be labelled two times, <b>30%</b> have been labelled differently. 
Especially, 3 movies have been assigned to opposite labels ! (two had the 3 labels and one had the opposite). 
"The notion of violence is complex and a clear definition of each level of violence will be crucial to create a good classification model" conclude Ada.

<h4>Movie violence classification</h4>
<p>
To classify the data, we will use the large language model <a target="_blank" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini">Chat-GPT-4o mini</a> from OpenIA. 
Following the past finding, Ada engineered a prompt with a clear set of instruction (classification and return type), A scale of violence with a clear definition of each levels, and a set of examples.
<div class="hover-container">
  Here for a deeper look into the model.
    <a href="3Methods#LLM" class="card">
         <h3 class="card__title">LLM model</h3>
         <div class="bloodCard">
          <div class="drops"> 
            <div class="drop1"></div>
            <div class="drop3"></div>
          </div> 
      </div>
    </a>
  </div> <br/>
We first classified the data between the 3 levels given to the crocodiles before, and secondly between 2 levels : violent and non-violent. 
<p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20746442"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20746442/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
The last model end up with <b>66.38% accuracy</b> on the validation set. <br/>
At both extreme, the model success to label the data most of the time, with some mislabelling to "Mild". Out of 116 movies, only 2 have a opposite labelling (violent to peaceful). 
Interestingly, the model tends to be more extreme than humans, labelling half of the mild category as peaceful of violent. For following analysis, we may remove the mild category. 
<br/><br/>
"The model perform relatively well. However, we saw that this labelling is subjective. To assess our classification, we will analyse the result using a Empath model." propose Ada. 
</p>

<h4>Validation of the classification</h4>

<p>
Now that the films are classified, we want to take a closer look at them before feeding them into our research model of the correlation between real and cinematic violence. <br/>
As a first step, we perform a 2-dimensional PCA regression on the entire dataset and represent the two main components. We see clusters! In fact, films dominated by emotions such that: kill, negative_emotion, death and crime are most correlated on the upper part of the plot. The lower part, on the other hand, is dominated by films of categories such that: children, party, home, wedding, family. <br/>
Clearly, the two types of films seem to be quite distinct: on the one hand, films that we can classify as violent and, on the other hand, peaceful films. <br/>

Armed with this information, we move on to the analysis of the films as categorised by Chat-GPT-4o mini, hoping to validate their classification. <br/>
For this, we extract the ten most represented categories in both categories. We clearly see a difference: violent films are categorised by kill, death, fight, war, etc.; whereas non-violent films deal with topics such as: travelling, communication, friends, wedding, etc. <br/>
For a more visual representation, we choose 10 films at random, for which we represent the percentage for each of the 10 most present categories.

<h4>A look into violent movies</h4>

Nice ! Now that we have violent movie, we can perform some analysis on them. <br/>
What are the main genre of violent and non violent movies ?

<p>
Main genre for violent movies are thriller, drama, horror, action/adventure, action and crime fiction. We can also see multiple other genre know to be tense. Interestingly, comedy, romance film and romantic drama also appear. <br/>
Main genre for non-violent movies are comedy, drama, romance film, family film and romantic comedy. A lot of children friendly genre are present. <br/>
</p>
<p>
However, some genre are present in the two list. This is expected, because some genre are obviously more represented in general such as comedy and drama. To account for that, we also plotted more present genre weigthed by the genre prevalence in general.
