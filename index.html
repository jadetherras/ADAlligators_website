    Mr Crocco Odile called the police at 3am this morning after hearing a sudden thud. "I was confused. This is usually a very quiet neighborhood, but this sound made my spine tingle. The police arrived too late: no criminals in sight, just the poor victim, no bruises, no blood, buried, no doubt. </p><p>
    What is more puzzling, however, is the increasing number of dead bodies in the city lately: not just in the Lagoon Swamp, not just in the Gator District, but everywhere. The authorities are calling for caution: don't go out alone at night, try to avoid crowds, report any suspicious activity. </p><p>
    We are looking for help to reduce violence in the city. The situation is dramatic. The government is ready to involve anyone who can help.</p>

                    <p>BERLIN — Searching the cab
                        of the tractor-trailer that plowed
                        through a Christmas market in
                        Berlin, the authorities made two
                        startling discoveries: a badly
                        bruised body with stab and gunshot
                        wounds, and the wallet of a
                        Tunisian labeled a security threat
                        who was supposed to have been
                        deported months ago.</p>
                    <p>The identity of the Tunisian,
                        Anis Amri, immediately alarmed
                        intelligence officials from Europe
                        to Washington. German officials
                        acknowledged that Mr. Amri was
                        known to have links to a radical
                        Salafist preacher and had been in
                        their custody pending deportation
                        proceedings after being caught
                        with fake papers. He was freed,
                        even though he
                        was considered
                        potentially dangerous
                        by the
                        authorities</p>

<p>
  "I feel that the world is becoming more and more violent...", thought Crocolock when reading its daily morning journal before heading to the police headquarters.
  And he knew he was not the only one filling this way : At work, they recently discussed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-06/Ipsos-Global-Advisor-Crime-Law-Enforcement-Full-Report.pdf">study</a> on reported crime and the perception of violence around the word. <br/>
  After acknowledging these news, Crocolock couldn't sit still. As one of the best detective of the Alligators's city, he wanted to understand more what could increase criminality.<br/>
  Confused, he decided to call his acolyte : Gatson, a very smart cinema critic. He had seen all movies released since the 1901 (nearly), and was so passionate about movies that he was sometimes disconnected from the real world.  <br/>
  "Hi, Gatson. Yes, it's Crocolock. Have you seen the news? Isn't it frightening, all this violence?" <br/>
</p>

<img style="float: right;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Gatson.png" alt="one other crocodile"/>
<p>"Uhm, no, I haven't Crocolock. But I read a <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262287/#:~:text=The%20results%20demonstrate%20that%20the,reduces%20behavioral%20inhibition%20in%20adolescents.
  ">interesting paper</a> recently, stating that the more time adolescents spend watching violent movies, the more they are prone to making wrong decisions, such as drug abuse or illegal driving. Everyone doesn't agree on the impact of 
  movies, of course, but that was still interesting."</p>
  
<p>
  An idea struck Crocolock's mind: could violence in real life and movie violence be correlated? <br/>
  That's how the investigation started! I ran to the headquarters as fast as he could and enter like a hurricane in Professor Ada ReptKing office to propose his thesis.</p>

<img style="float: left;padding-right: 20px;" class="gators" src="assets/img/Professore_Ada_Reptking.png" alt="again a crocodile"/>
  <p>
    CALM DOWN Croco, you almost look like a hot-blooded ! You can't just claim a correlation because your gut tell you so ! <br/>
    Enough crocodile tears ! let's be Pragmatic : you have to perform data analysis, and I will help you, if you brings me some datasets and a coffee.
  </p> 
  <p>
    First, we have to state a clear problematic and a set of research Questions.</p> <br/>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How do real word violence and movies violence influence each other ? </h1> 
<p>
  Can we identify periods of abnormally many releases of violent movies? Can we identify genres that are particularly violent?
  Is there a significant (positive or negative) correlation between the prevalence of violent movies and reported violent crimes in the US ? 
  In another word, can we say that violent movies increase real-world violence, or that they serve as a release that reduces it?
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, let's define the context.<br/> 
  Violence, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/so0006#:~:text=Violence%20refers%20to%20the%20intentional,a%20community%2C%20or%20a%20government.">UUDR</a>, 
  refers to the intentional or unintentional use of force whether physical or psychological, threatened or actual, against an individual, oneself, or against a group of people, a community, or a government. <br/>
  We will focus on the United state of America, relating violent events within each states to the release of violent movies in the area. 
  </p>

    <h2 class="titlefunfact">FunFact : Crocodile tears</h2>
    <img class="imgPostIt" src="assets/img/SadCroco.webp" alt="Workflow">
    <p class="textfunfact">"Crocodile tears" is a expression standing for a insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. 
      The phrase derives from an ancient belief that crocodiles shed tears while consuming their prey. <br/>
      Actually, crocodile produce tears to hydrate there eyes, this is not linked to emotion and can be triggered by feeding !

<p>
To be able to correlate real life violence and movies violences, we first have to quantify violence on both side. <br/>
Our data journey will begin with the study of violence in movies starting from the CMU movie dataset. <br/>
Secondly, we will analysis the national incident-based reporting system of the FBI to construct a violence score for each states of america.<br/>
Finally, we will asses the correlation between the two metrics using an auto-regressive distributed lack model.
</p>

<img style="margin: auto;"src="assets/diagram/workflow.png" alt="Workflow">


<h2>Movie violence classification</h2>
<p>
Fortunately, said Ada, We have the CMU movie Dataset. Since time will play a crucial role in our study and precise release dates are often unavailable, missing dates were filled using another Movies Dataset from Kaggle.
If you are interested, you can find more about these datasets in the  <div class="hover-container"> dataset pages

    </div>
    </a>
  </div> .
</p>

<h4>Violence subjectivity</h4>
<p>
  We have to construct a metric for violent movies. 
  To do so, we have to classify american movies in different level of violence, using only the plots we have. 
  But what about subjectivity ? <br/>
  "We can conduct a pilot survey to manually classify a subset of movies !" propose Gatson.
</p>
<p>
  We asked people to classify in 3 categories :
  <ul>
    <li>Violent</li>
    <li>Mild</li>
    <li>Peaceful</li>
  </ul>
 Each movies have been classified multiple times to compare the result between different individuals. We relabelled all data with ambiguous result to create a validation set for the following classification model.
</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20744430"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20744430/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
150 movies have been labelled. Across the 80 that have at least be labelled two times, <b>30%</b> have been labelled differently. 
Especially, 3 movies have been assigned to opposite labels ! (two had the 3 labels and one had the opposite). 
"The notion of violence is complex and a clear definition of each level of violence will be crucial to create a good classification model" conclude Ada.

<h4>Movie violence classification</h4>
<p>
To classify the data, we will use the large language model <a target="_blank" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini">Chat-GPT-4o mini</a> from OpenIA. 
Following the past finding, Ada engineered a prompt with a clear set of instruction (classification and return type), A scale of violence with a clear definition of each levels, and a set of examples.
<div class="hover-container">
  Here for a deeper look into the model.
    <a href="3Methods#LLM" class="card">
         <h3 class="card__title">LLM model</h3>
         <div class="bloodCard">
          <div class="drops"> 
            <div class="drop1"></div>
            <div class="drop3"></div>
          </div> 
      </div>
    </a>
  </div> <br/>
We first classified the data between the 3 levels given to the crocodiles before, and secondly between 2 levels : violent and non-violent. 
<p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20746442"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20746442/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
The last model end up with <b>66.38% accuracy</b> on the validation set. <br/>
At both extreme, the model success to label the data most of the time, with some mislabelling to "Mild". Out of 116 movies, only 2 have a opposite labelling (violent to peaceful). 
Interestingly, the model tends to be more extreme than humans, labelling half of the mild category as peaceful of violent. For following analysis, we may remove the mild category. 
<br/><br/>
"The model perform relatively well. However, we saw that this labelling is subjective. To assess our classification, we will analyse the result using a Empath model." propose Ada. 
</p>

<h4>Validation of the classification</h4>

<p>
Now that the films are classified, we want to take a closer look at them before feeding them into our research model of the correlation between real and cinematic violence. "But how ?" ask Gatson.<br/>
As a first step, we perform a 2-dimensional PCA regression on the entire dataset and represent the two main components. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20754617"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20754617/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>

We see clusters! In fact, films dominated by emotions such that: kill, negative_emotion, death and crime are most correlated on the upper part of the plot. The lower part, on the other hand, is dominated by films of categories such that: children, party, home, wedding, family. <br/>
Clearly, the two types of films seem to be quite distinct: on the one hand, films that we can classify as violent and, on the other hand, peaceful films. <br/>

Armed with this information, we move on to the analysis of the films as categorized by Chat-GPT-4o mini, hoping to validate their classification. <br/>
For this, we extract the ten most represented categories in both categories. 

<div class="GraphContainer">
  <label class="switch">
    <input type="checkbox" class="graph-toggle" data-target="group3">
    <span class="slider"></span>
  </label>

  <div class="graph-group" id="group3">
    <div class="violent">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20754069"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20754069/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
 </div>

    <div class="peaceful">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20754397"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20754397/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

We clearly see a difference: violent films are categorized by kill, death, fight, war, etc.; whereas non-violent films deal with topics such as: travelling, communication, friends, wedding, etc. <br/>
For a more visual representation, we choose 10 films at random, for which we represent the percentage for each of the 10 most present categories.
</p>

<h4>A look into violent movies</h4>

Nice ! Now that we have violent movie, we can perform some analysis on them. <br/>
What are the main genre of violent and non violent movies ? 

<div class="GraphContainer">
  <label class="switch">
    <input type="checkbox" class="graph-toggle" data-target="group1">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Main genre for violent movies are thriller, drama, horror, action/adventure, action and crime fiction. We can also see multiple other genre know to be tense. Interestingly, comedy, romance film and romantic drama also appear. <br/>
Main genre for non-violent movies are comedy, drama, romance film, family film and romantic comedy. A lot of children friendly genre are present. <br/>
</p>
<p>
However, some genre are present in the two list. This is expected, because some genre are obviously more represented in general such as comedy and drama. To account for that, we also plotted more present genre weigthed by the genre prevalence in general.

This analysis is limited. A lot of genre here are really "niche" but we can still see a clear tendency. For violent movie, we have genre such as psychological horror, wars or hardcore pornography. For non-violent movies we have travel, children's, education, fitness or journalism...
<h4>What does the time say ?</h4>

This is time to try to answers to our first question : are violence movies more present today ?

Let's take a look at the distribution of violent movies in time.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20790058"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20790058/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
If we look only the number of violent movie, we can easily said : yes, the number of increase ! However, there is a trick there. Look now at the total number of movie release per year. The number of violent movie and the total number of movie increase following the 
same pattern. 
</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20853357"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20853357/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
<p>
Look at the ratio of violent movies over all the movies. Surprise, the ratio do increase, but really slowly. We can say that there is in general more violent movie per year between 1970 and 2013 than between 1913 and 1940. There is a sudden increase in the 70', with no return to the precedent ratio afterward.
We also observe a oscillation between period with relatively high and low number of violent movies. 
Fo example, the ratio drop around 1917, 1921, 1929, 1937. More recently, there is a drop in 1979 and a spike in 1981. Outliers at the border are due to the low number of movie data.
</p>

<p>
  Here for the years, but within a year, is there a pattern ? When are the violent movie release ? </p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20791318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20791318/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>
  Similarly, the violent movie trend follow the total movie trend. In general, more movies are release at the beginning of september (the beginning of the academic year !) and at the end and beginning of the year (for christmas and to start the new year!).
  Less movies are release in the summer. Does people watch movie during hot holidays ?
  Additionally, the ratio of violent movie is constant across the weeks.
</p>

<p>
  To end this analysis, you can watch the distribution of violent movies release and total movie release within the years !

  "In order to run a meaningful correlation analysis of violence in films on real-world violence, you need to think of your independent variable as a <i>treatment</i>", said Ada.
  For this, our classification of films in violent and peaceful comes in handy! However, this was only the first step. We need more information about the movies that we classified as violent! 
  So how can we follow Ada's advice? 
</p>
<p>
  Let's break it down this way: Simply counting the number of violent movies released in a specific timespan does not seem to fully grasp the complexity of our question of interest. 
  A good intention for this statement is the following: If there are a lot of violent movies released, but nobody watches them, we do not assume those movies to have a large influence on the society. 
  On the other hand, if there is only one violent movie released, but nearly everybody watches it, it could have a significant influence on society! Having this in mind, we search for a variable that could capture the popularity of the violent movies released.
</p>
<p>
  For this, one information seems quite suitable: the box office revenue! The box office revenue is highly correlated with the popularity of a movie, i.e. it is high when a lot of people watched the movie (popular movie) and low when only a few people watched it (unpopular movie). 
  Using the box office revenue of the films we classified as violent, we can thus approximate the prevalence of violent movies during a specific time period.
  Therefore, we choose the box office revenue as the <i>treatment</i>, i.e. our main independent variable, for the correlation analysis!
</p>
<p>
  Delighted about our findings, we go back to Professor Ada. "You have done a very good job so far, the box office revenue seems as a good proxy for the prevalence of violent movies." answered Ada with a satisfied smile on his face. 
  "To go further and not loose any time, I forward you directly to my colleague from the finance department, Prof. Dexter CrossProfit. He has all the financial data you need."
</p>

<p>
  "Of course I can provide you the box office revenues of all your films in the dataset! Let me just crunch some data.", said Dexter, turned on some heavy-metal music and disappeared behind his computer. 
  After 5 minutes, he clapped his hands and said "All done, folks! It's all in the CMU dataset." <br/>
  Full of motivation, we continue our analysis: We filter the CMU dataset to only include the movies we classified as violent and use the release date to extract the week and the year in which the film was released. <br/>
  For the explanation about the weekly time window, please see in the <div class="hover-container">

            </div> 
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
    Counting the number of violent movie releases as well as summing up the box office revenues of all violent movies per week thus gives us the final dataframe for the violent movie side. 
    We now have those values for every week in the time span 1901 - 2018.

Here we are, this is the end of the journey, and what a journey !
We found violent movies and anayzed trends in both violent and peaceful scenario. We extracted a 
metrics for the popularity of a movie using the box office. Then, we worked with real word data to analyse the level of 
violence in the USA, and extract a metrics of violence. Finally, we correlate this two findings to evaluate the correlation between real life
violence and movie violence.

  In was the end of the adventure for Crocolock, but he knew he will have soon new mystery to resolve. The sunlight
  was slowly dissapearing, transforming the water in a red and orange painting. Peacefully, he came back where he belong.
